                You are given a text prompt, which describes a video. You are to perform the following tasks:

                1. Infer the objects, people, and elements present in the scene, the camera perspective,
                and the spatial relationships between entities.
                
                Then, extract the KEY OBJECTS that undergo PRIMARY, DISCRETE, and TRACKABLE motion
                across the video frames.

                KEY OBJECT SELECTION RULES (STRICT):
                - Key objects MUST be discrete physical entities with clear boundaries
                (e.g., ball, rock, person, vehicle).
                - DO NOT select passive environments or background media such as
                water, air, ground, sky, walls, or containers,
                UNLESS they are explicitly the primary moving actor.
                - Motion must be intrinsic to the object itself,
                not merely a reaction caused by another object.

                EXAMPLES:
                - Ball collision → output "ball"
                - Orange juice poured into a cup → output "liquid"
                - Flames burning → output "fire"
                - Light and shadow change → output "light"
                - Object falling into water → output the falling object(s), NOT "water"

                If multiple key objects exist:
                - Output up to THREE words.
                - If there is a containment or interaction relationship,
                output the discrete moving objects rather than the container or medium.
                
                2. Create a detailed, movie-like description of the scene that evokes visuals with strong
                detail and composition cues. This is the Context Frame. It should clearly describe the objects/people/elements present in the scene, the perspective of the camera, and the spatial relationships between the objects in it as well as the details not explicitly mentioned in the text prompt.  
                The context frame must depict the initial state of the scene, before any action occurs, and must not foreshadow the input prompt. Given an input prompt "A man throws a ball", the context frame should depict a man holding a ball at his side, not in mid-throw. Given an input prompt "A man squeezes a ball in his hand", the context frame should depict a man gently holding a ball in his palm, not squeezing it yet. Given an input prompt "A dolphin emerges from the water", the context frame should depict a calm ocean. The dolphin should not be visible yet. The context frame should be written as if it is depicting an image, not a video. Hence, it should not foreshadow what will happen next.

                3. Create a concise, one-sentence description of the context frame. This should be a short, one-sentence description of the context frame.

                4. Infer a sequence of consequences or changes implied by the text prompt.
                Use assertive language to describe changes in appearance, shape, color, size, and position.
                
                5. Assign physics tags to the video prompt. There are five options: [Solid Mechanics, Fluid Dynamics, Optics, Magnetism, Thermodynamics, Unknow]. If the object in the video is a rigid body (such as a ball collision, a wooden block sliding, etc.), please output 'Solid Mechanics'; if the object in the video is a fluid (such as pouring water, stirring coffee, etc.), please output 'Fluid Dynamics'; if the phenomenon in the video is related to thermodynamics (such as flame burning, ice melting), please output 'Thermodynamics'; if a phenomenon related to magnetism occurs in the video, please output 'Magnetism'; if none of them occurs, please output 'Unknow'. 
                
                Output the results clearly separated into:

                You are given an input prompt, which describes a video. You are also given a sequence of keyframes (1 or more keyframes), meant to depict key moments of the video. You are also given a hint, describing what happens throughout the video. You are to predict the next keyframe in the sequence. Use precise language to clearly describe the changes that may occur in this next key. You must predict what may happen within the next 5 seconds of the video. Hence, do not predict too far into the future.

                A keyframe is a still image that captures either the start, peak/intermediate stage, the end, or the consequence of an event. The next predicted keyframe MUST ONLY depict either the start, peak, end, or consequence of an event and NEVER a combination of them.

                e.g. The key moments of kicking a ball into a goal are (1) The moment the foot makes contact with the ball. The ball should not have moved at this point., (2) The moment the ball is inside the goal.
                e.g. The key moments of ice melting are (1) When the ice is fully solid (2) The moment the ice cube is half melted (3) The moment the ice cube is completely melted with a large puddle of water.
                e.g. The key moments of a glass of water falling off a table are (1) The moment the glass of water is on the edge of the table, (2) The moment the glass of water is falling midair towards the ground (3) The moment the glass of water makes contact with the ground but is still in one piece. (4) The moment the glass of water shatters on the ground and the water spills everywhere.

                If the next key moment involves contact between two objects, then the next keyframe must depict the moment of contact. The objects must be touching in the next predicted keyframe description. Your caption for the next keyframe should not use comparative language to describe a relative change in position, distance, or size (e.g. towards, away from). Instead, it should describe the absolute position, distance, or size of the objects involved. If possible, use spatial prepositions to clarify the relationship between objects (e.g. inside of, on top of, and below). The next keyframe should describe the image as if it is not in motion. Hence, avoid using phrases like 'about to', 'going to'. Describe the next keyframe as if it is a still image.

                Finally, return 'True' if the next predicted keyframe is the last frame of this video, otherwise, return 'False'. If nothing significant happens after the next predicted keyframe, return 'True'.

You will receive a reference image, its segmentation map, the initial bounding box where motion starts, and a textual description of the video content. Your task is to predict the bounding box coordinates for the next 13 frames.The video frame size is 720x480 (width × height). The top-left coordinate is [0, 0], and the bottom-right coordinate is [720, 480]. When predicting, ensure that different bounding boxes do not overlap or exceed the frame boundaries. \n\nEach frame should be represented as [{'id': unique object identifier, 'name': object name, 'box': [box top-left x-coordinate, box top-left y-coordinate, box width, box height]}, ...]. Each box should not include more than one object. Your predicted frames must encapsulate the whole scenario depicted by the initial information. Your predicted frames must fully represent the entire scenario described by the initial information. The movement of objects in the predicted frames should follow the laws of physics, such as bouncing during collisions, changing directions, and other related phenomena. For example, when two objects collide, their speed and direction will be influenced by the point of impact, and their motion will adjust according to the laws of momentum and energy conservation. \n\nWhen predicting future bounding boxes, objects must not change direction, accelerate, or begin new motion states (such as bouncing, sliding, or stopping) unless a direct physical contact has clearly occurred between their bounding boxes. A collision can only be inferred when the predicted bounding boxes overlap or touch at their edges. If no bounding boxes are in contact, their motion state must continue as expected from prior frames.\n\nYou should check whether the collision condition is satisfied, such as whether the bounding boxes are in contact.\n\nIn the prediction process, you should plan the possible motion of each object in the scene caused by collisions. Additionally, the collision between objects may cause overlap, and their movement trajectories should conform to real-world physical principles, such as the effects of gravity, friction, and other forces. You only need to focus on the objects provided to you in the first frame, and no need to pay attention to anything else. Your predictions should infer which physical laws apply, such as Gravity, Conservation of Momentum, Fluid Mechanics, Thermodynamics, Magnetic Force, etc. For example, under the action of gravity, the ball will accelerate and rebound after colliding with the ground. When two balls move towards each other, the material, volume, density, etc. of each ball must be considered, and the collision process satisfies the law of conservation of momentum. Assume objects move and interact based on real-world physics. The camera follows perspective geometry. Even if an object disappears and reappears, its bounding box should maintain the same ID across frames. If necessary, you may make reasonable assumptions.Before generating bounding box coordinates for each frame, provide step-by-step reasoning. Refer to the examples below for the desired format. Never use markdown or other formats not in the examples. Do not start each frame with `-`. Do not include any comments in your response.

                Step1-Analysis Caption and determine the physical laws to be satisfied: As can be seen from the caption, the topic of this study is about the free fall of a small ball, so this topic needs to satisfy Newton's laws of motion, focusing on the impact of gravity.
                Step2-Analyze the impact of this physical law: In accordance with Newton's laws of motion, gravity will cause the small ball to perform free fall motion, vertically accelerate and hit the table, and rebound after the collision. Due to energy loss, the height of each rebound will decrease, which is in line with the law of conservation of energy and momentum.
                Step3-Analyze the impact on box coordinates: The horizontal motion of the ball is negligible, so the x coordinate remains basically unchanged. Due to the vertical acceleration, the y coordinate of the small ball will gradually increase and the interpolation of the y coordinate between each two frames will also gradually increase. After colliding with the table, the small ball rebounds, the y coordinate decreases, and the small ball decelerates vertically upward. Subsequently, the small ball continues to accelerate vertically and collides with the table for the second time. After the third collision, the small ball is stationary on the table, and the y coordinate remains unchanged. Since the ball is a rigid body, it will be slightly compressed at the moment of collision with the desktop. Therefore, the width in the box coordinates remains unchanged, the height decreases slightly, and then quickly returns to normal. The width and height will not change for the rest of the time.

                Caption: On the left side of the desktop, there is a small, glossy sphere, and on the right side, another small, glossy sphere. Both spheres are identical in size and texture, with a subtle shine that reflects the ambient light. The left sphere begins to roll slowly to the right, while the right sphere rolls slowly to the left. They move at a steady pace, gradually approaching each other. When the two spheres collide in the center of the desktop, there is a subtle, satisfying click sound. Upon impact, the spheres compress slightly, then rebound in opposite directions. The left sphere rolls back to its starting position, and the right sphere does the same, slowing down as they move away from each other. The lighting is soft and even, casting gentle shadows beneath the spheres as they move. The overall atmosphere is calm and precise, with a focus on the physics of the collision and the smooth motion of the spheres.

                Step1-Analysis Caption and determine the physical laws to be satisfied: From the caption, we can know that the theme of this time is that two rigid balls move towards each other and collide, so the movement must satisfy Newton's laws of motion, and the law of conservation of momentum is satisfied when colliding.
                Step2-Analyze the impact of this physical law: According to Newton's laws of motion, the left and right balls move towards each other with uniform acceleration. The law of conservation of momentum is satisfied when a collision occurs. According to the provided caption and the width and height of the two balls, we know that the two balls are made of the same material and have the same volume. After the collision, the two balls will move in the opposite direction before the collision and decelerate uniformly to a stop.
                Step3-Analyze the impact on box coordinates: The bounding boxes of the two balls are ball1: [200, 240, 50, 50] and ball2: [520, 220, 50, 50], which means [x, y, w, h]. Based on the reasoning, the motion direction of ball1 is [|x2 + w2/2 - x1 - w1/2|, |y2 + h2/2 - y1 - h1/2|] = [320, 20], normalize it to get [0.94, 0.06], which represents the motion direction of the ball. Let's assume that the ball moves 30 units per frame. The condition for the balls to collide is dist((x1, y1), (x2, y2)) < (w + h) / 4. After the collision, the motion direction of the balls will reverse. In the real world, the positions of the two balls will not overlap

                Step1-Analysis Caption and determine the physical laws to be satisfied: As the theme involves ice melting, the process is governed by heat transfer (thermal conduction and convection) and phase transition laws (solid to liquid). Thermodynamics dictates that heat from the surrounding environment flows into the ice until equilibrium is reached.
                Step2-Analyze the impact of this physical law: According to heat transfer principles, the ice block will gradually lose structural integrity as it absorbs energy. Melting will cause water droplets to form on the surface, pooling around the base. Convection currents in the surrounding air/water may create uneven melting patterns, leading to irregular shape changes. The volume of the ice will shrink over time, with liquid water spreading outward, influenced by gravity and surface tension.

If the ice slides due to uneven melting or water lubrication, the XY position may shift slightly, but it will usually be fixed at the initial contact point.

On the right side, place an identical long, slender bar magnet with its north pole (N) facing to the left, directly opposite the first magnet. The right magnet begins to slowly move towards the left magnet. As the two north poles approach each other, the left magnet is visibly repelled and slides away to the left due to the magnetic force. The right magnet pauses briefly, then continues to move closer again, causing the left magnet to be repelled once more, sliding further away. Focus on the smooth, realistic motion of the magnets, the subtle vibrations as they repel each other, and the clean, reflective surface of the desktop.

Key principles include magnetic repulsion, dipole-dipole interaction, and the conservation of energy in magnetic field systems.
                Step2-Analyze the impact of this physical law: Due to like-pole repulsion, the magnets will experience a mutual force pushing them apart. If unconstrained, they will move to minimize overlap while maintaining a stable equilibrium distance determined by their magnetic strength and external constraints. Magnetic field lines between the poles will diverge outward, creating a region of high magnetic flux density around the gap. If fixed in place, stress and potential torsional motion (e.g., rotation to reduce repulsion) may occur. Energy dissipation through air resistance or friction will dampen oscillations if the system is perturbed.
